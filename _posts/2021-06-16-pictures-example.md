The simplex supports not only embedding pictures but also includes a lightbox plugin. Read the post and check out various examples.

## Dogs

Try to click on the following picture:

<a href="/assets/img/posts/doggo1.jpg" data-lity>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/doggo1_thumb.jpg"/>
</a>

You see? A big doggo appeared.

---

Images can be centered:

<a href="/assets/img/posts/doggo2.jpg" data-lity class="sx-center">
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/doggo2_thumb.jpg"/>
</a>

---

You don't have to use the lightbox feature. In that case, simply use markdown image tag:

![A picure without lightbox](/assets/img/posts/doggo1_thumb.jpg)

---

There also can be a simple description under the picture:


<div class="sx-center">
    <div class="sx-picture">
    <a href="/assets/img/posts/doggo2.jpg" data-lity>
        <img src="/assets/img/posts/doggo2_thumb.jpg"/>
    </a>
    <span class="sx-subtitle">My picture description.</span>
    </div>
</div>
